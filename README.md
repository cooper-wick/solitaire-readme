# Solitaire

## Overview
**Solitaire** is a command-line implementation of classic solitaire card games written in **Java**, supporting multiple rule variants including **Klondike** and **Whitehead**. The game allows players to select the desired solitaire variant via command-line arguments at runtime.

The project follows a **Model–View–Controller (MVC)** architecture, separating game logic, user interaction, and presentation. Gameplay is driven entirely through textual input and output, emphasizing clear state representation, input validation, and rule enforcement.

This project was developed as part of **Northeastern University’s CS3100 (Object-Oriented Design)** course and is archived as a demonstration of early-stage software design, MVC architecture, and test-driven development.
